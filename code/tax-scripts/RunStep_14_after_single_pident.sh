# This is a sourceable bash script that runs steps 1-13 of the workflow.  
# In addition to avoiding problems that happened with pasting blocks of code,
# This lets you run multiple pidents in paralelle which makes it faster.
# The actual commands in this script are identical to the workflow commands
# that you type directly into the terminal command line.
# The only additional code is an array of pidents and a loop to run them all.
# RRR 1/12/16

# Do this after checking for bugs with RunSteps_1-13_single_pident.sh 
# and then running 1-13 in paralelle with RunSteps_1-13_after_single_pident.sh

# Choose pidents to test over.

pident=("100" "99" "98" "97" "96" "95")


# Now run step 14- plotting everything together to choose final pident
# First generate the arguments for the command call:

args_string=""
for p in ${pident[*]}
do
   args_string+=" conflicts_$p ids.above.$p $p"
done

# 14
Rscript plot_classification_disagreements.R otus.abund plots regular NA $args_string

printf 'Steps 1-14 have finished running.  Now analysze the plots from step 14 to choose your final pident and generate your final taxonomy file in step 15.  Optionally you can compare to how your taxonomy would have been in step 16. At the end tidy up your working directory with step 17. \n \a'
